Are you a young, possibly financially illiterate person? 
Stocks and Finance can be so boring, all these numbers... who cares anyway

What if there was an app that made securing your future financial freedom as easy as your every day doom-scroll?

## Small but mighty react app

With the help of two financial information API's this app allows for the user to scroll away at stock options in a format similar to the most popular app in the world 
(won't be named due to copyright reasons).

## The Process

The app currently uses a faux server built by us that returns a JSON Response for its "Random Option", in doing so the app can be easily reconfigured to accept actual market information for Investors,

The App was built in Reactjs by:
    - Henry Rennell
    - Tales Pinto
    - Leon Yu
over a period of about 3 days.
